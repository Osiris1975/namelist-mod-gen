Osiris's Namelist Mod


Tired of your fleets and armies running around with names like %SEQ% ever since the 3.6.0 patch? 

Interested in some name lists inspired by history but with a dash of creative flair from a 

very, very, very minor but published sci-fi author? Want to give him a pat on the back for spending way-too-many hours

trying to figure out how to make %SEQ% go away?



Then you've come to the right place! The debut of Osiris's Namelists for Stellaris features three namelists generated

by either the delectable combination or caustic mix (you be the judge!) of Osiris's namelist-generator-mod tool and

the only-slightly-creative mind of this very, very, very minor author (like seriously minor, you could buy a bag of chips

with how much he's been paid for his writing...okay, maybe a little more than that).



Enough about him (me). Also, this is his(mine) first mod. Be gentle...
