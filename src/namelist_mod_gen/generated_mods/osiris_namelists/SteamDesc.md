[h1]Osiris's Namelist Mod[/h1]

Tired of your fleets and armies striking fear into their enemies with names like %SEQ% ever since the 3.6.0 patch? 
Interested in some name lists created inspired by history but with a dash of creative flair from a 
very, very, very minor but published sci-fi author? Want to give him a pat on the back for spending way-too-many hours
trying to figure out how to make %SEQ% go away?

Then you've come to the right place! The debut of Osiris's Namelists for Stellaris features three namelists generated
by either the delectable combination or caustic mix (you be the judge!) of Osiris's namelist-generator-mod tool and
the only-slightly-creative mind of this very, very, very minor author (like seriously minor, you could buy a bag of chips
with how much he's been paid for his writing...okay, maybe a little more than that).

Enough about him (me). Also, this is his(mine) first mod. Be gentle...
