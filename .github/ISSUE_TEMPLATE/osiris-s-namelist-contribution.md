To submit a namelist to the mod.

1. Download and fill out the [CSV template](https://github.com/Osiris1975/namelist-mod-gen/blob/main/examples/template/template.csv). See the [mod's existing CSV files](https://github.com/Osiris1975/namelist-mod-gen/tree/main/examples/input_csvs) for examples. See the [Stellaris Namelist wiki entry](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Empire_modding#Name_lists) for more details. Make sure you've followed proper formatting for sequential names as described in the Wiki.  If you already have the mod files you can upload them here.

2. Attach the CSV file to this ticket.

3. The CSV file will be reviewed for errors and content.

4. If accepted, it will be added to the mod at the next release and you will receive attribution on the mod's description page on Steam.

As always, thank you for your submission!
